# Amazon Bedrock
## What is it
A fully managed service that provides access to high-performance foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies, as well as Amazon's own models, through a unified API.
## What it's for
Facilitates the building of generative AI applications, allowing developers to experiment, evaluate, and customize FMs with their own data, without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
## Use cases
    - Text generation for content creation (articles, emails, blog posts).
    - Summarization of documents and long texts.
    - Code generation for development task automation.
    - Creation of chatbots and virtual assistants with more natural responses.
    - Research and information retrieval from large volumes of data.
    - Image generation from text descriptions.
## Key points
    - **FM Access:** Provides access to a variety of foundation models, including text, image, and multimodal models.
    - **Unified API:** Allows interaction with different FMs through a single API.
    - **Customization:** Enables customization of FMs with your own data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
    - **Fully managed:** AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building applications.
    - **Security and privacy:** Your data remains private and is not used to train the foundation models.
    - **Model evaluation:** Tools to evaluate and compare the performance of different FMs for your use case.
## Comparison with developing generative AI models from scratch:
    - **Amazon Bedrock:** Simplifies and accelerates the development of generative AI applications by providing access to pre-trained FMs and tools for customization and deployment. Reduces the need for ML expertise and development time.
    - **Developing generative AI models from scratch:** Requires a team of highly specialized data scientists and ML engineers, large volumes of training data, compute-intensive infrastructure, and significant investment of time and resources. Suitable for very specific use cases that require highly customized and proprietary models.
