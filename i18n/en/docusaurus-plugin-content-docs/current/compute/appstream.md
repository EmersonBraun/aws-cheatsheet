# Amazon AppStream 2.0

## What it is
A fully managed application streaming service that allows you to deliver desktop applications to users from the cloud without the need to rewrite code.

## What it's for
Allows users to access desktop applications instantly from anywhere, on any device, without the need to install applications locally. Ideal for software that requires high processing power or needs to be accessed by many users in different locations.

## Use cases
- Streaming engineering, design, and media applications to users in different locations.
- Providing secure access to business applications for remote employees.
- Delivering software as a service (SaaS) to customers without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.
- Training and education, allowing students to access specific software without complex installations.

## Key points
- **Fully Managed:** AWS handles infrastructure, scalability, and maintenance.
- **Instant Access:** Users can access applications quickly from any web browser.
- **Security:** Applications run in the cloud, and only pixels are transmitted to the user's device, keeping data secure.
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales to meet user demand.
