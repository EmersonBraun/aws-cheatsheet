# AWS EC2 Auto Scaling

## What is it
A service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your application to maintain performance and availability while optimizing costs.

## What it's for
Automatically scaling your application's compute capacity up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Use cases
- Web applications with variable traffic
- Batch processing jobs
- Applications with predictable load patterns
- High-availability applications
- Cost optimization for variable workloads

## Key points
- **Dynamic scaling:** Automatically adjusts capacity based on demand
- **Predictive scaling:** Uses machine learning to predict traffic patterns
- **Scheduled scaling:** Scales based on predictable load changes
- **Health checks:** Automatically replaces unhealthy instances
- **Multiple scaling policies:** Target tracking, step scaling, and simple scaling

## Comparison
- **AWS EC2 Auto Scaling vs. Manual Scaling:** Auto Scaling automatically adjusts capacity based on demand, reducing operational overhead and ensuring optimal performance. Manual scaling requires human intervention to add or remove instances, which can lead to over-provisioning or under-provisioning. Auto Scaling is ideal for applications with variable workloads, while manual scaling might be suitable for applications with stable, predictable loads.
