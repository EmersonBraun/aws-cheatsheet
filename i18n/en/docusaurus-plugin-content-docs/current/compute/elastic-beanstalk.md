# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## What is it
A fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in multiple languages on AWS without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications.

## What it's for
Simplifying the deployment and management of web applications and services by handling the infrastructure details automatically.

## Use cases
- Web application deployment
- API development and deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Development and testing environments
- Production application hosting

## Key points
- **Easy deployment:** Deploy applications with a few clicks or commands
- **Multiple platforms:** Supports various programming languages and platforms
- **Automatic scaling:** Handles capacity provisioning and load balancing
- **Health monitoring:** Monitors application health and performance
- **Customization:** Allows customization of the underlying resources

## Comparison
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk vs. Manual EC2 Deployment:** Elastic Beanstalk automates the deployment and management of applications, handling infrastructure details automatically. Manual EC2 deployment gives you complete control over the infrastructure but requires more management overhead. Elastic Beanstalk is ideal for developers who want to focus on their code rather than infrastructure management.
