# AWS Lambda

## What is it
A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, automatically scaling your applications in response to incoming requests.

## What it's for
Running event-driven applications and microservices without managing servers, paying only for the compute time you consume.

## Use cases
- Event-driven applications
- Microservices architecture
- Real-time file processing
- IoT backends
- API backends
- Scheduled tasks

## Key points
- **Serverless:** No server management required
- **Event-driven:** Executes code in response to events
- **Automatic scaling:** Scales automatically with the number of requests
- **Pay-per-use:** Pay only for the compute time you consume
- **Multiple languages:** Supports various programming languages

## Comparison
- **AWS Lambda vs. EC2:** Lambda is a serverless service that automatically scales and charges only for the compute time used. EC2 requires server management and charges for the entire time the instance is running. Lambda is ideal for event-driven, short-lived functions, while EC2 is better for long-running applications that need more control over the environment.
