# AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## What is it
A fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster.

## What it's for
Running and managing containerized applications at scale, with built-in support for load balancing, auto-scaling, and service discovery.

## Use cases
- Microservices architecture
- Batch processing
- Application migration to containers
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- High-availability applications

## Key points
- **Container orchestration:** Manages container deployment and scaling
- **Service integration:** Works with ALB, CloudWatch, and other AWS services
- **Task definitions:** Define container configurations and requirements
- **Auto scaling:** Automatically scales based on demand
- **Security:** IAM roles and security groups integration

## Comparison
- **AWS ECS vs. EKS:** ECS is a simpler container orchestration service that's easier to get started with and integrates well with other AWS services. EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that offers more advanced features and is better for complex container orchestration needs. ECS is ideal for AWS-focused deployments, while EKS is better for organizations that need Kubernetes compatibility or have more complex container orchestration requirements.
