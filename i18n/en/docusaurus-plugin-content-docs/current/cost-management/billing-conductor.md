# AWS Billing Conductor

## What it is
A custom billing service that allows AWS partners and organizations with custom chargeback requirements to customize billing rates, distribute credits and fees, and allocate shared indirect costs.

## What it's for
Simplifies and automates billing workflows and reporting for customers who need a customized billing view, such as managed service providers (MSPs) or companies with multiple business units.

## Use cases
- Create pro forma invoices for customers or internal departments.
- Customize billing rates for different AWS services.
- Distribute credits and discounts granularly.
- Allocate costs for shared resources (e.g., AWS Support, AWS Organizations) among accounts.
- Generate custom usage and cost reports for chargeback purposes.

## Key points
- **Custom billing:** Allows you to set custom prices for AWS services.
- **Cost visibility:** Provides detailed cost views for each customer or business unit.
- **Automation:** Automates the process of generating invoices and reports.
- **Billing hierarchy:** Lets you create a billing hierarchy that reflects your organization's structure.
- **Integration:** Integrates with AWS Organizations and AWS Cost Explorer.

## Comparison with AWS Billing and Cost Management
- **AWS Billing Conductor:** Focused on customization and automation of billing for complex chargeback scenarios and for partners who need to bill their customers based on their own pricing rules. Adds a layer of customization over standard AWS billing.
- **AWS Billing and Cost Management:** Provides basic tools to manage and optimize costs for your own AWS account, including invoice viewing, cost analysis, and budgets. Does not offer the same flexibility to customize billing rates for third parties or business units.
