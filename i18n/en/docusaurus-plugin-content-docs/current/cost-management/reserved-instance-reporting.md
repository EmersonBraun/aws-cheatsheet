# Reserved Instance Reporting

## What is it
Features within AWS Cost Explorer and other cost management tools that allow you to monitor and analyze the utilization and coverage of your Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans.

## What it's for
Optimizing the use of RIs and Savings Plans, identifying savings opportunities, and ensuring you are maximizing the benefits of these long-term commitments.

## Use cases
- View RI and Savings Plans utilization over time.
- Identify underutilized or unused RIs.
- Analyze RI coverage to determine if more RIs are needed.
- Forecast potential savings from purchasing new RIs or Savings Plans.
- Generate reports for audit and compliance.

## Key points
