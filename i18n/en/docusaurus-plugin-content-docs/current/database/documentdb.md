## Comparison
- **AWS DocumentDB vs. MongoDB Atlas:** DocumentDB is AWS's managed MongoDB-compatible service, offering deep integration with other AWS services. MongoDB Atlas is MongoDB's own managed service, offering more MongoDB-specific features. DocumentDB is ideal for AWS-focused deployments, while Atlas is better for organizations that need the full MongoDB feature set or have multi-cloud requirements.
