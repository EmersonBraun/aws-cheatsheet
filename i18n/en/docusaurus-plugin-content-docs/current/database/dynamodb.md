## Comparison
- **AWS DynamoDB vs. MongoDB:** DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service with automatic scaling and predictable performance. MongoDB is a document database that can be self-managed or used as a service. DynamoDB is ideal for applications that need predictable performance and automatic scaling, while MongoDB is better for applications that need more flexible querying capabilities or document-based data modeling.
