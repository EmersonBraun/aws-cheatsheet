# AWS Keyspaces

## What is it
A fully managed, serverless, and scalable Apache Cassandra-compatible database service that makes it easy to run Cassandra workloads on AWS.

## What it's for
Running Cassandra-compatible applications in the cloud, with the benefits of AWS's security, reliability, and scalability, without managing servers.

## Use cases
- Time-series data
- IoT applications
- Real-time analytics
- High-scale applications
- Session management

## Key points
- **Cassandra compatible:** Works with existing Cassandra applications
- **Serverless:** No servers to manage
- **Scalability:** Automatic scaling of throughput and storage
- **High availability:** Multi-AZ deployment
- **Security:** Encryption at rest and in transit

## Comparison
- **AWS Keyspaces vs. Self-managed Cassandra:** Keyspaces is a fully managed service that eliminates the operational complexity of running Cassandra. Self-managed Cassandra gives you more control but requires you to handle all operational tasks. Keyspaces is ideal for applications that need Cassandra compatibility without the operational overhead, while self-managed Cassandra is better for organizations that need complete control over their Cassandra infrastructure.
