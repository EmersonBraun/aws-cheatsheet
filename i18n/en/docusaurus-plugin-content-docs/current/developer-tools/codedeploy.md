# AWS CodeDeploy

## What is it
A fully managed deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, AWS Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS.

## What it's for
Simplify and automate the software deployment process, reducing application downtime and manual errors.

## Use cases
- Continuous deployment of web and mobile applications
- Updating applications on EC2 and on-premises servers
- Lambda function deployments
- Automatic rollback of failed deployments
- Deployments to different environments (development, testing, production)

## Key points
- **Fully managed:** AWS handles the deployment infrastructure
- **Automation:** Automates the entire deployment lifecycle
- **Multi-platform support:** Deploys to EC2, on-premises, Lambda, and ECS
- **Deployment strategies:** Supports in-place and blue/green deployments
- **Rollback:** Allows automatic rollback of failed deployments
- **Integration:** Integrates with AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, Amazon S3, and other AWS services

## Comparison with manual deployment
- **AWS CodeDeploy:** Automates the deployment process, reducing errors and downtime. Ideal for frequent and complex deployments
- **Manual deployment:** Requires users to execute commands and steps manually, which is error-prone, time-consuming, and not scalable for large environments or frequent deployments
