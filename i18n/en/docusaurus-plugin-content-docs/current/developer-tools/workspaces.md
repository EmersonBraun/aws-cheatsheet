# Amazon WorkSpaces

## What is it
A fully managed cloud-based virtual desktop service (Desktop-as-a-Service - DaaS).

## What it's for
Provision virtual desktops for your users, allowing them to access applications, documents, and resources from anywhere, at any time, on virtually any device.

## Use cases
- Providing secure and managed desktops for employees
- Supporting remote and hybrid workers
- Standardized development and testing environments
- Secure access to confidential data and applications
- Reducing hardware costs and desktop management

## Key points
- **Fully managed:** AWS handles the provisioning, patching, backups, and scalability of virtual desktops
- **Access from anywhere:** Users can access their WorkSpaces from laptops, tablets, smartphones, and thin clients
- **Security:** Data remains in AWS, reducing the risk of data loss on local devices
- **Flexibility:** Supports Windows and Linux operating systems, and a variety of virtual hardware configurations
- **Pay-as-you-go:** You pay monthly or hourly, depending on the chosen plan

## Comparison with traditional desktops

- **Traditional desktops:** Require local management of hardware, software, and security, which can be expensive, complex, and less flexible for remote workers
