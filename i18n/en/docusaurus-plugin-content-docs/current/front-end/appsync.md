# AWS AppSync

## What is it
A managed service for developing GraphQL APIs that enables applications to get exactly the data they need, when they need it.

## What it's for
Simplify GraphQL application development by providing a managed GraphQL API that connects to multiple data sources and offers real-time features.

## Use cases
- Developing mobile and web applications with offline synchronization
- Building GraphQL APIs for microservices
- Implementing real-time features (e.g., chat, notifications)
- Aggregating data from multiple sources into a single API
- Developing applications with low-latency requirements

## Key points
- **Managed GraphQL:** AWS handles the GraphQL API infrastructure and scalability
- **Real-time:** Supports GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates
- **Multiple data sources:** Integrates with DynamoDB, RDS, Lambda, HTTP APIs, and more
- **Offline synchronization:** Supports offline data synchronization for mobile applications
- **Security:** Integration with AWS IAM, Amazon Cognito, and custom authorizers
- **Caching:** Offers multi-level caching for better performance

## Comparison
- **AWS AppSync:** Ideal for building GraphQL APIs that require real-time features, offline synchronization, and data aggregation from multiple sources. Focused on query flexibility and data efficiency.
- **Amazon API Gateway:** A versatile service for creating and managing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs. It's more generic and suitable for a wide range of APIs, including those that don't require GraphQL or advanced real-time features.
