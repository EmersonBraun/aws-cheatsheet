- Simulations and rendering

## Key Points
- **Low Latency:** Proximity to end-users
- **Compatibility:** Standard AWS services
- **Connectivity:** High-speed with AWS regions
- **Flexibility:** Selective workload deployment
- **Consistency:** Same tools and APIs
- **Integration:** Compatible with existing services

## Comparison with Traditional AWS Regions
- **AWS Local Zones:** Offers lower latency for specific users, ideal for applications requiring real-time response.
- **AWS Regions:** Provide greater service availability and redundancy options, but may have higher latency for distant users.
