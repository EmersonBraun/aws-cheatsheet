# FreeRTOS

## What is it
An open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) for microcontrollers and small embedded devices.

## What it's for
Enable small, low-power devices to securely connect to AWS cloud services, such as AWS IoT Core, and perform real-time tasks.

## Use cases
- Firmware development for IoT devices
- Embedded applications with real-time requirements
- Device connectivity to AWS cloud
- Task management and communication between components in embedded systems
- Industrial automation and control applications

## Key points
- **RTOS:** Provides operating system functionality for embedded devices, such as multitasking, task scheduling, and inter-task communication
- **Open source:** Software license that allows use in commercial systems
- **Small and efficient:** Designed to run on microcontrollers with limited resources
- **AWS IoT integration:** Facilitates secure device connection to AWS cloud and integration with IoT services
- **Reliability:** Developed with emphasis on reliability and ease of use

## Comparison
- **FreeRTOS:** A lightweight RTOS optimized for devices with limited resources and real-time requirements. Ideal for applications where response needs to be predictable and fast.
- **Embedded Linux:** A more robust general-purpose operating system with more features, suitable for devices with more processing power and memory. Offers greater flexibility but may have higher latency and resource consumption.
