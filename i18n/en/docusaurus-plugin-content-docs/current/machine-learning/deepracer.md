# AWS DeepRacer

## What it is
A 1/18 scale autonomous racing car, fully programmable, designed to help developers of all skill levels learn and experiment with reinforcement learning (RL).

## What it's for
Provides a fun and practical way to learn RL, allowing users to train models in a simulated environment and then test them on a physical car.

## Use cases
- Learning and experimentation with reinforcement learning.
- Autonomous racing competitions to test and optimize RL models.
- Development of machine learning and artificial intelligence skills.
- Prototyping of autonomous control and navigation algorithms.

## Key points
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Focus on RL, where an agent learns to make decisions through trial and error, receiving rewards for desired actions.
- **Simulation:** Allows training models in a virtual environment before deploying them to the physical car.
- **Hardware and Software:** Combines a physical car with a cloud software platform for training and evaluation.
- **Community:** Has an active community and global competitions to engage users.
- **Accessibility:** Designed to be accessible to developers with different levels of ML experience.
