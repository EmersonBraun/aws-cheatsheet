# Amazon SageMaker

## What is it
A fully managed machine learning (ML) service that helps developers and data scientists build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.

## What it's for
Simplify the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring in production.

## Use cases
- Building and training ML models for various applications (computer vision, natural language processing, prediction)
- Deploying ML models in production for real-time or batch inference
- Data preparation and engineering for ML
- ML model experimentation and optimization
- Building no-code ML solutions (with SageMaker Canvas)

## Key points
- **Fully managed:** AWS handles the underlying infrastructure for model training and deployment
- **Comprehensive tools:** Offers notebooks, pre-built algorithms, training and deployment environments, and monitoring tools
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales computing resources for training and inference
- **Integration:** Integrates with other AWS services, such as S3, Lambda, Glue, and ECR
- **SageMaker Studio:** A unified IDE for the entire ML workflow
- **SageMaker Canvas:** Enables business users to build ML models without writing code

## Comparison
- **Amazon SageMaker:** Simplifies and accelerates ML development and deployment by abstracting infrastructure complexity. Ideal for teams that want to focus on data science and models.
- **ML training on EC2 (self-managed):** Offers complete control over the environment but requires manual setup and management of servers, ML libraries, and tools. Can be more complex and time-consuming to set up and maintain.
