# AWS Organizations

## What is it
An account management service that allows you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into a single organization that you create and manage centrally.

## What it's for
Simplify the management of complex AWS environments with multiple accounts, enabling centralized policy enforcement, automated account creation, and consolidated billing management.

## Use cases
- Centralized management of multiple AWS accounts
- Enforcing security and compliance policies across all accounts
- Automating the creation of new accounts for different teams or projects
- Consolidated billing for all organization accounts
- Resource sharing between accounts

## Key points
- **Master account:** A central account to manage the organization
- **Organizational Units (OUs):** Allows grouping accounts into hierarchies for granular policy application
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs):** Allow control over the maximum permissions available to accounts in an OU
- **Consolidated billing:** Aggregates billing for all accounts into a single invoice
- **Integration:** Integrates with other AWS services for management and security

## Comparison
- **AWS Organizations:** Simplifies management, security, and billing of multi-account AWS environments, enabling centralized governance and automation. Essential for companies with a significant AWS footprint.
- **Individual account management:** Each account is managed independently, which can be complex, error-prone, and difficult to scale in environments with many accounts.
