# AWS Trusted Advisor

## What it is
A service that acts as a personalized advisor, inspecting your AWS environment and providing recommendations to optimize costs, improve performance, increase security, enhance fault tolerance, and monitor service limits.

## What it's for
Helps you follow AWS best practices, identify cost-saving opportunities, and improve the security and reliability of your applications.

## Use cases
- Cost optimization (e.g., identifying idle or underutilized EC2 instances).
- Security improvement (e.g., checking for open security group ports, IAM configurations).
- Performance enhancement (e.g., identifying instances with high CPU usage).
- Fault tolerance improvement (e.g., checking resource redundancy).
- Service limit monitoring (e.g., alerting before reaching EC2 instance limits).

## Key points
- **Five check categories:** Cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, performance, and service limits.
- **Actionable recommendations:** Provides clear guidance on how to resolve identified issues.
- **Continuous updates:** Checks are regularly updated with AWS best practices.
- **Integration:** Accessible via AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and SDKs.
- **Support levels:** Some checks are available to all customers, while others require Business or Enterprise support plans.

## Comparison
- **AWS Trusted Advisor:** Automates best practice checks for AWS, providing proactive and continuous recommendations. Reduces manual effort and time needed to identify and resolve issues.
- **Manual audits:** Time-consuming, error-prone, and may not cover all best practices. Require specialized knowledge and can be difficult to scale in large environments.
