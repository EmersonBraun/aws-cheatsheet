# AWS Security Hub

## What it is
A cloud security posture management service that automates security best practice checks, aggregates security alerts from multiple AWS services and partners, and supports automated remediation.

## What it's for
Provides a comprehensive view of your AWS security posture, helping you identify and prioritize security findings and assess your environment against security standards.

## Use cases
- Aggregating and prioritizing security findings from services like GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector, and partners.
- Automated compliance checks against security standards (e.g., AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark).
- Centralized visualization of your security posture in a dashboard.
- Automating incident response using Amazon EventBridge.
- Managing security findings across multiple AWS accounts.

## Key points
- **Findings aggregation:** Collects security findings from multiple AWS services and partners in one place.
- **Compliance checks:** Continuously evaluates your environment against security standards.
- **Centralized dashboard:** Provides a consolidated view of your security posture.
- **Response automation:** Enables automated actions based on security findings.
- **Integration:** Integrates with GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector, IAM, EventBridge, and other services.

## Comparison
- **AWS Security Hub:** Centralizes and simplifies security management, providing a unified view and automating compliance checks. Reduces the complexity of managing security alerts from multiple sources.
- **Fragmented security management:** Requires you to monitor and manage security alerts from each service individually, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and make it difficult to get a holistic view of your security posture.
