# AWS Backup

## What is it
A fully managed service that centralizes and automates data protection across AWS services and hybrid workloads.

## What it's for
Simplify backup management by enabling you to define centralized backup policies for multiple AWS services and on-premises resources, and automate backup creation, retention, and restoration.

## Use cases
- Centralized backup of data from multiple AWS services (e.g., EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, EC2, Storage Gateway)
- Backup of on-premises workloads using AWS Storage Gateway
- Automation of backup and retention policies
- Disaster recovery and business continuity
- Compliance with regulatory backup requirements

## Key points
- **Centralized management:** Define backup policies in a single location for multiple services
- **Automation:** Automates backup creation, retention, and deletion
- **Multi-service support:** Supports a wide range of AWS services and on-premises resources
- **Encryption:** Backups are encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Recovery:** Enables easy and quick data restoration from backups
- **Cost-effective:** Pay only for backup storage and data transfer
- **Cross-region and cross-account copy:** Allows copying backups to other regions and accounts for greater resilience

## Comparison
- **AWS Backup:** Provides a fully managed, centralized, and automated backup solution for the AWS and hybrid ecosystem, reducing operational complexity and costs. Ensures data compliance and resilience.
- **Traditional backup solutions:** Require users to manage the entire backup infrastructure, including software, hardware, and storage, which can be complex, expensive, and error-prone. Can be difficult to scale and integrate with cloud services.
