# Getting Started

This AWS Cheatsheet is your comprehensive companion for AWS certification preparation.
Each AWS service is presented in a structured format with three key sections: Use Cases,
Key Points, and Comparisons. This organization helps you quickly understand when to use
each service, what's important to know for the exams, and how services relate to each other.

## What you'll find in each service section

Our structured approach covers everything you need to know for AWS certifications:

- **Use Cases:** Real-world scenarios and applications where each service
  excels, helping you understand practical implementations
- **Key Points:** Essential concepts, features, and limitations you need
  to know for the certification exams
- **Comparisons:** Clear comparisons between similar services, helping you
  make the right architectural decisions and answer exam questions correctly

## How to use this guide?

- **For Use Cases:** When you need to understand practical applications
  and real-world scenarios for each service
